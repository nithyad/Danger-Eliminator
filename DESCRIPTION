These files are part of the Danger Eliminator App, which my partners and I made as a part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 
at Adobe Systems in the Summer of 2015. Danger Eliminator is a safety app with multi-dimensional features aimed at a generation that carries
their phones everywhere. Features of the app include pre-set text messages to 911, direct lines to hotlines, guides for the most common 911 
calls, directions to the nearest hospitals, and direct line to 911.
